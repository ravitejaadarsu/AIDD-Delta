# Dispatch Protocol

How many agents, who owns which files, parallel or sequential, and in what order — by
**lookup**, never by judgment. The orchestrator does not decide fan-out; it resolves it
from the table below, records the resolved plan, and executes it.

This exists because re-deciding dispatch every step is the framework's largest source of
overhead and drift: the same step gets a different shape on every run, ownership arguments
get re-litigated, and nobody can tell afterwards what was supposed to happen. A table has
none of those failure modes.

## Resolution algorithm

Once per step, in this order:

1. Read the step's `(phase, unit-of-work)` pair from its playbook — or, for the `PR review`
   rows, from the numbered phases of `pr-review.md`, which is a protocol rather than a
   playbook because an external PR review sits outside the phase machine.
2. Read `rigor.mode` from change state (`rigor-modes.md`). Absent → `standard`.
3. Look up the row. The row gives the unit count for that mode, the ownership rule, the
   dispatch mode, the cap, and the deterministic order.
4. Apply the **ownership rule** (below). Disjointness unproven → sequential.
5. Apply the **cap** — units beyond it queue in the documented order.
6. Record the resolved plan in `supervision/audit.log` (format below).
7. Execute exactly that plan. Do not revisit it within the step.

## Decision table

Unit counts read `fast / standard / critical`. A unit is one dispatch of one role.

**`Class` is the row's stable identifier**, and it is what everything downstream keys on: the
`class` column of `cost/ledger.md` (`../templates/cost-ledger.md`), the per-class medians and
projection in `aidd-cost.sh` (`cost-governance.md` §4), and the `class=` field of the
recorded dispatch plan. It exists because the `Step` cell cannot do that job — `QA 1` names
two different rows, and `QA 3, 5, 9` and `QA 4, 5, 10` are compound, so grouping cost on the
step text would merge unrelated dispatches and split related ones. Class ids are unique
within this table, and an id is never reused for a different unit of work.

## Ownership rule (mechanical)

Parallel dispatch is permitted **only** when the units' file-ownership sets are provably
pairwise disjoint per `file-scope.md`. Three ways a plan proves it, and one that does not:

1. **Artifact-disjoint by construction** — each unit writes exactly one artifact named by
   its own unit key (`pre-review/<dimension>.md`, `qa/tests/<category>.md`,
   `arch-candidates/<lens>.md`, `audit/interrogation/<subject-id>-*.md`). Distinct keys ⇒
   distinct paths ⇒ disjoint. No further reasoning needed.
2. **Declared-ownership-disjoint** — builders. The orchestrator pairwise-intersects the
   wave's `file_scope.owns` exact paths and `file_scope.creates` prefixes
   (`file-scope.md` rule 1). Empty intersections ⇒ parallel.
3. **Append-shared ⇒ never parallel** — two units appending to the SAME file
   (`audit/negotiation-log.md`, one `audit/debate/<category>.md`, a story file's report
   sections) are sequential, always, whatever the table's cap says.
4. **Unproven ⇒ sequential.** If disjointness cannot be proven from the epic's ownership
   sets or from rule 1, the answer is sequential in the row's documented order. There is no
   case-by-case reasoning, no "probably fine", no reading the code to guess.

Sequential order is the row's **deterministic order** — story-id, dimension name, category
name, subject-id, ac-id, or repo-relative path, ascending. Ascending means byte-wise
ascending on the exact identifier string, so two runs of the same step produce the same
order.

### PR review: artifact-disjointness and the different-agent routing rule

The `PR review` rows are artifact-disjoint by construction (rule 1), and their unit keys are
what proves it: `pr1-file` writes `pr-review/files/<path-slug>.md`, one per changed source
file; `pr1-sweep` writes `pr-review/sweeps/<bundle>.md`; `pr1-dim` writes
`pr-review/dimensions/<dimension>.md`; `pr2-verify` writes
`pr-review/verdicts/<finding-id>.md`; `pr3-cross` and `pr4-comments` write one file each.
Distinct keys ⇒ distinct paths ⇒ parallel is permitted with no further reasoning. Per-file
agents never share an artifact, so two agents can never both own a file's findings.

`pr2-verify` carries one extra mechanical rule the other rows do not (`pr-review.md` §6.1):
**a finding is never verified by the agent that raised it.** Every finding carries
`raised_by: <unit-key>` written by its finder, verification is dispatched only as the
`adversarial-verifier` role — never as a role that raises findings — and the plan line
records `finding=<id> raised_by=<unit-key> verified_by=<verifier-unit>` with
`verified_by ≠ raised_by` asserted before dispatch. Above 12 findings the row groups
verification by FILE; a group is never handed to a finder that raised anything in it.

## Runtime without parallelism

The fallback is not a different plan — it is the same units, the same count, the same
order, run one at a time. Results are order-independent because units communicate only
through artifacts (`../playbooks/00-pipeline.md`). The recorded plan states
`mode=sequential reason=runtime-no-parallel`, so the degradation is explicit and the
Supervisor can see the plan was not silently reshaped.

## Batching rule

Units beyond the cap **queue** in the documented order and dispatch as slots free. Never
spawn beyond the cap to go faster: the cap is what keeps the context and the audit trail
of a step bounded. Never drop queued units to fit the cap either — a unit the table
requires runs, or the step is incomplete.

## Never re-decide

The table is consulted **once per step**. The orchestrator records the resolved plan and
must not revisit it within the step — not after a slow unit, not after a failure, not
because a returning unit suggests a different split. A unit that fails follows its own
remediation ladder in its playbook (re-dispatch, blocked path, fix loop); remediation
re-dispatches the SAME unit, it does not re-shape the plan.

**Re-deciding a dispatch plan mid-step is a supervision VIOLATION.** The evidence of the
breach is the audit log itself: two `dispatch-plan` lines for one step token, or executed
dispatches that do not match the recorded plan. A step whose scope genuinely changed
(backflow delta stories, an escalated rigor mode) does not re-decide the old step — it
starts a NEW step with a new token and its own single plan.

Recorded as one line in `supervision/audit.log` (`supervision.md` format, role
`orchestrator`, status `dispatched`). `class=` carries the row's class id, which is what
lets the Supervisor match the plan against the ledger rows it produced:

```text
2026-08-06T10:14:02Z | construction | orchestrator | wave-2 | dispatched | dispatch-plan class=con2a-builder units=3 agents=3 mode=parallel cap=4 order=ST-004,ST-005,ST-006
```

## Worked examples

### Inception — pre-review, `standard`

Row `Inception 11`: units 4, parallel (artifact-disjoint), cap 4, dimension asc.

```text
units   = coupling-risk, feasibility, pattern-fit, test-strategy
agents  = 4 (Reviewer mode=pre, one dimension each)
order   = as listed (ascending); parallel — each writes only pre-review/<dimension>.md
queue   = none (4 ≤ cap 4)
```

In `fast` the same row yields 2 units (`feasibility`, `pattern-fit`), 2 agents, same rule.

### Construction — 7 stories, 3 waves, `standard`

`epic.md`: wave 1 = ST-001, ST-002, ST-003, ST-004, ST-005 (all ownership sets pairwise
disjoint); wave 2 = ST-006, ST-007 (disjoint); wave 3 = ST-008, the seam story, solo.

```text
wave 1  builders: units 5, disjoint ⇒ parallel, cap 4
        ⇒ agents 4 (ST-001..ST-004), ST-005 queued, dispatched as the first slot frees
        then 1× Master Agent monitor (wave-1)
        then Auditor interrogation: 5 subjects, artifact-disjoint ⇒ parallel, cap 4
             ⇒ 4 subjects, 5th queued; 1 round each (standard)
        then integration check (sequential, alone)
wave 2  builders: units 2, disjoint ⇒ parallel, 2 agents
        then monitor ×1, interrogation 2 subjects (parallel), integration check
wave 3  builders: units 1 (seam) ⇒ sequential by count
        then monitor ×1, interrogation 1 subject, integration check
```

Three plan lines, one per wave; 3 monitoring notes; 8 interrogation verdicts. Nothing about
this is re-decided when ST-005 returns late — it takes the freed slot, and the plan stands.

### QA — `standard`, 9 findings (2 CRITICAL, 3 HIGH, 4 MEDIUM)

```text
step 1  6 dimension units (5 + delta) ⇒ parallel, cap 6 ⇒ 6 agents
        + 1 security auditor in parallel (own artifact)
step 3  adversarial verifier: units = CRITICAL/HIGH only = 5 ⇒ parallel, cap 6 ⇒ 5 agents
        order = finding number asc; MEDIUMs get no verifier (advisory unless escalated)
        + 1 Master Agent monitor (review batch, sequential, after the batch closes)
step 5  test engineer: 5 categories (standard) ⇒ parallel, cap 6 ⇒ 5 agents
        debate: design surface only, ≤2 exchanges, strictly sequential
step 7  E2E verifier alone; step 8 evidence post; step 9 AC assessor; step 11 tally
step 12 auditor final audit subjects ⇒ parallel, cap 4, 1 round each
step 13 negotiation: one disputed AC at a time, ac-id asc, ≤1 exchange each
```

In `critical` the same step 5 row yields 8 categories: 6 dispatch, 2 queue.

### Delivery — `standard`

Row `Delivery 1`: 2 units. The Doc Writer edits `docs/**`, README, CHANGELOG; the Delivery
Agent commits the whole tree. The commit set is not disjoint from the doc set, so rule 4
applies:

```text
units  = doc-writer, delivery-agent-prep
proof  = commit set ⊇ doc set ⇒ NOT disjoint
plan   = sequential, documented order: doc-writer, then delivery-agent-prep
```

Then steps 2–4 sequential (1 agent), the Supervisor final report, and the phase boundary
audit — the two dispatches no mode and no table row ever removes.

### PR review — 9 changed files, `standard`

Merge-base diff: 5 source files (one of them a component whose `use-device-flags` helper
landed in the same PR), 2 renamed-only files, 2 pipeline YAML files. Finders raise 14
findings.

```text
phase 0  ground truth: git merge-base + git rev-parse; BASE/HEAD recorded as evidence
phase 1  pr1-file : 4 units (the component + its helper are ONE bundle, one agent)
                    ⇒ parallel, cap 6, order path asc
         pr1-sweep: 2 units (cosmetic = the 2 renames · config-e2e = the 2 YAMLs)
         pr1-dim  : 6 units ⇒ parallel, cap 6, dimension asc
phase 2  pr2-verify: 14 units (EVERY finding, not only CRITICAL/HIGH)
                    ⇒ parallel, cap 6 ⇒ 6 dispatched, 8 queued, finding id asc
                    each verified_by ≠ raised_by, asserted on the plan line
phase 3  pr3-cross: 1 unit, sequential, holds all 12 finder artifacts + all 14 verdicts
phase 4  pr4-comments: 1 unit, sequential, last
```

Four plan lines, one per phase with a fan-out. In `fast` the same rows yield the same 4
per-file agents (the floor does not move), **1** merged sweep bundle, and **2** dimension
specialists.
